Welcome to BNT.

--- Unix based installs ---

STEP ONE:

Uncompress the archive into the desired directory. For example:

[user@BNT /user]$ cd public_html
[user@BNT public_html]$ tar zxvf ~/BNT-0.XX-unstable-complete.tar.gz

If you are doing so directly onto a Unix machine, the permissions should be set
automatically. If not, then please refer to the OFFICIAL CHMOD LIST.

STEP TWO:

Use your webbrowser to access install.php, follow the instructions.

STEP THREE:

Before you run make_galaxy, follow the instructions, which tell you to make sure to: 
[user@BNT public_html]$ chmod 0704 config/db_config.php 

STEP FOUR:

Finally, edit your crontab. Crontabs on unix allow the system to periodically update values in the game, including 
adding turns and degrading sector defenses.

The entry in crontab should look like this:
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/lynx http://example.com/scheduler.php?swordfish=sword-pass >/dev/null

STEP FIVE:

Now you should be all set, just run the make galaxy script now: http://www.example.com/user/make_galaxy.php

In case you have permissions problems, we have included the chmod's we perform prior to tarballing:

OFFICIAL CHMOD LIST:

chmod -R 0505 BNT
cd BNT
mkdir templates_c
chmod -R 0507 templates_c
chmod 0404 check_defenses.php
chmod 0404 combat.php
chmod 0404 fader.php
chmod 0404 global_funcs.php
chmod 0404 header.php
chmod 0404 ai_funcs.php
chmod 0404 sched_apocalypse.php
chmod 0404 sched_degrade.php
chmod 0404 sched_igb.php
chmod 0404 sched_ai.php
chmod 0404 sched_news.php
chmod 0404 sched_planets.php
chmod 0404 sched_ports.php
chmod 0404 sched_ranking.php
chmod 0404 sched_spies.php
chmod 0404 sched_turns.php
chmod 0404 sched_repair.php
chmod 0404 sector_fighters.php
chmod 0404 spy_funcs.php
cd config
chmod 0404 *

--- Windows based installs ---

STEP ONE:

Unzip the release into your docroot.

STEP TWO:                 

Use your webbrowser to access install.php, follow the instructions.

STEP THREE:               

Make sure to set the attributes on db_config.php to be read-only after your install.

STEP FOUR:

Find a way to run a scheduled update. Whether you use a windows version of lynx/cron, or windows scheduler,
you need to have a web-browser of some kind access the scheduler page.

It should load the scheduler page once every 5 minutes, and it should look like this:

http://example.com/scheduler.php?swordfish=sword-pass

STEP FIVE:

Run the make_galaxy.php script.


Troubleshooting issues:

Q: I'm on Windows, and I get error...
A: Please post it on our bug form at sourceforge.

Q: I'm using php-4.02... 
A: The only version of php currently supported is 4.22+. Older versions will almost definitely not work, and we will NOT help with problems
you encounter trying to install with any version older than 4.22. php-4.22 was released over two years ago as of this writing, and numerous security
problems existed in versions prior to 4.22. Further, numerous functions in the game require a recent version of php.

Q: I'm using php-5...
A: We have been able to get the game running on php5, but we don't support it officially yet. If you'd like to assist with our efforts to get it 
officially supported, let us know!

Q: I get a fatal error about require'ing phpSniff
A: This is because your version of php is too old. You need to upgrade to a recent version. If you *still* see the error after upgrading to at least
php-4.22, please let us know.

Q: I get an error about Smarty
A: Ensure that smarty is in backends/smarty . If you STILL have the problem, try redownloading it. On occasion downloads can
become corrupted. Also ensure the ownership is set according to the chmod directions above.

Q: I get an error about adodb
A: Ensure that adodb is in backends/adodb. If you STILL have the problem try redownloading it. On occasion downloads can 
become corrupted. Also ensure the ownership is set according to the chmod directions above.

Q: I'm using totally-rarely-used-webserver...
A: The only webserver currently supported is Apache. Other webservers will almost definitely work, but we will NOT help with 
problems you encounter trying to install with any version other than Apache.

Q: HA! Mr. I-AM-SURE, I found an issue not listed here!
A: Great, report it to us at http://www.blacknova.net .

Enjoy.
