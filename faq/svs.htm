                    Ship to ship combat happens in a very straightforward 
                    manner.</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>First, attacker engines and defender engines are 
                      compared. A chance to attack is determined by this 
                      formula: success=(10-defender engines+attacker engines)*5. 
                      This number is then compared to a random number between 1 
                      and 100. If the random number is higher than the success 
                      number, the attack goes on. Otherwise you get a message 
                      saying &quot;Target out maneuvered you!&quot;.<ul>
                        <li>Here's an example. If your engines are 13 and his 
                        engines are 16, then we calculate the success rate as 
                        (10-16+13)*5. The result is 35. Hence, you have a 65% 
                        chance (35% chance to fail) to succeed.</li>
                      </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>Second, attacker sensors and defender cloak are 
                      compared. A chance to attack is determined by this 
                      formula: success=(10-defender cloak+attacker sensors)*5. 
                      This number is then compared to a random number between 1 
                      and 100. If the random number is lower than the success 
                      number, the attack goes on. Otherwise you get a message 
                      saying &quot;Unable to get a lock on target!&quot;.<ul>
                        <li>Here's an example. If your sensors are 7 and his 
                        cloak is 3, then we calculate the success rate as 
                        (10-3+7)*5. This result is 70. This means you have a 
                        straight 70% chance of success.</li>
                        <li>This looks the same as the above engines check, but 
                        here you get the success percent right away. There you 
                        have to subtract from 100. Looks like two different 
                        people wrote this code. Incidentally, there's always at 
                        least a 5% success or 5% failure chance. Nothing is 
                        certain.</li>
                      </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>If combat is a go; If the defender has an Emergency 
                      Warp Device, it is used and the defender is sent to a 
                      random sector between 1 and the max sector number<ul>
                        <li>Combat, of course, would end. If the defender has no 
                        Emergency Warp Devices, combat is continued. </li>
                      </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>First, beams are exchanged against fighters. The 
                      attacker beams will destroy up to half of the defenders 
                      fighters and vice versa.
                      <ul>
                        <li>For example, you have 20,000 beams and he has 14,000 
                        fighters. Your beams will take out 7,000 fighters (half) 
                        and leave you with 13,000 beams left over. If you had 
                        20,000 beams and he had 47,000 fighters, you would take 
                        out 20,000 fighters. That would leave you with 0 beams 
                        and leave him with 27,000 fighters.</li>
                      </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>This step only happens if either player has any beams 
                      left. Assume we have beams left. The attackers beams will 
                      go against defenders shields. If the beams are higher, 
                      they will negate all of the shields and there will still 
                      be some beams left over. The same thing goes for the 
                      defender's beams against your shields.<ul>
                        <li>For example, you have 7,000 beams left over from the 
                        previous step. Your opponent has 20,000 shields. Your 
                        beams would take away 7,000 shield points and your beams 
                        would be done. If he had had only 6,000 shields, your 
                        beams would have taken away all shields and left you 
                        with 1,000 beams left over.</li>
                      </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>This step also only happens if there are beams left 
                      over from the previous two steps. In this step, attackers 
                      beams are matched up against defenders armor. If your 
                      beams are greater than his armor, then he is going to die. 
                      If your beams aren't high enough, you just take away that 
                      many points of armor.<ul>
                        <li>For example, you have 3,000 beams left over and the 
                        opponent has 40,000 armor. You'll take away 3,000, 
                        leaving him with 37,000 armor. If he had 3,000 armor or 
                        less, he would die in the conflict. Death equates to an 
                        armor rating of 0 or less.</li>
                      </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>Now we have an exchange of torpedoes. Torpedoes have a 
                      damage rating of 10. This is something that can be changed 
                      in the configuration file, so it might not always be the 
                      same. First off, torpedo damage is calculated by 
                      multiplying the number of torpedoes you have by the 
                      torpedo damage rate. So, if you had 400 torpedoes, your 
                      torpedo damage would be 4,000 (400*10).<ul>
                        <li>If the defender has any fighters left, the torpedo 
                        damage will take out up to half of them. It's basically 
                        the same as with the beams. So, if your torpedo damage 
                        is 4,000 and defenders fighters is 5,000, you will take 
                        out 2,500 fighters. That'll leave you with 1,500 worth 
                        of torpedo damage to work with. If he had had 10,000 
                        fighters, you would have taken out a full 4,000 of them. 
                        You wouldn't have any torpedo damage left though.</li>
                      </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>If you have any torpedo damage left, it is applied to 
                      the defender's armor. So, if you had 4,000 torpedo damage 
                      left, you'd take away 4,000 armor.</li>
                      <li>Now, fighters attack. Your original fighters total is 
                      subtracted from his fighter total, and his original total 
                      is deleted from yours. This might not seem immediately 
                      intuitive, but it is. Some examples;<ul>
                        <li>You have 40,000 and he has 36,000. You'll end up 
                        with 4,000 left over and he'll end up with 0. </li>
                        <li>You have 20,000 and he has 20,000. You'll both end 
                        up with 0. </li>
                        <li>You have 15,000 and he has 27,000. You'll end up 
                        with 0 and he'll end up with 12,000. </li>
                      </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>If there are any fighters left, they are applied to 
                      the defender's armor. So, if you have 34,000 fighters 
                      left, you can do 34,000 damage to defenders armor. If the 
                      defender doesn't have enough armor left, too bad.</li>
                      <li>The last step is to test whether or not either player 
                      is dead. If either player has armor of 0 or less, they are 
                      dead. If you die, life sucks. You learned a hard lesson. 
                      If your opponent dies and you live, you get some money 
                      based on salvaging his ship.</li>
