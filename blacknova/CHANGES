Version 0.3.1
-------------

SharpBlue (09 December 2001)
-------------------------------
Modified rankings generation to select only ships that aren't
destroyed. Speeds it up by over 50% on big games.


SharpBlue (06 December 2001)
-------------------------------
Log viewer admin module added.


SharpBlue (04 December 2001)
-------------------------------
New log services. The logs are now kept in the database instead
of in a file. Each event has a define in the global_funcs file,
with an attached text string in the language files. The log.php
file parses the log data and outputs an intelligible string.

Also played with DHTML for the log interface. Works fine in IE,
NS6 and Mozilla. DHTML is simply disabled for browsers that
don't support it, outputting a simple table instead. Added a field
to the ships table so that users can explicitely disable DHTML if
they don't like it.


SharpBlue (03 December 2001)
-------------------------------
Fixed the broken screen resolution cookie code. Fonts for the
main interface are now dynamically selected, depending on the
screen resolution. Hopefully this will make the main interface
better for those with a resolution above 800x600. X resolution
is stored in a cookie called screenres.


SharpBlue (02 December 2001)
-------------------------------
Modified ports so you can buy more than 999,999 mine deflectors
in a single shot.

Fixed the IGB so that it displays right in Netscape 4


SharpBlue (01 December 2001)
-------------------------------
Anti-cheat measures:
 - Setting not to allow credit transfers to/from corporate planets
 - Setting to allow for a minimum player worth for capturing planets
 - IP ban module in the admin script

Addition of a new scheduler to the game. This makes the use of
the sysupdate.php3 file obsolete, as well as genrank.php3 and
gen_news.php. Settings can now be set in real-time, and the
actual system update interval does not affect any longer the game
speed.


SharpBlue (30 November 2001)
-------------------------------
Anti-cheat measures:
 - Timestamp on transfers to control the frequency of IGB 
   transfers 

Invitation into an alliance log "blank name" bug fixed
Trade routes now link the source port
Fixed sector_id not sorting in planet_report.php3
Various language fixes


SharpBlue (29 November 2001)
-------------------------------
Completely new IGB system
Anti-cheat measures :
 - Percent of worth limit on IGB transfers
 - Min turns allowed for IGB transfers

Version 0.3.0 released (17 November 2001)
-------------------------------

SharpBlue (13 November 2001)
-------------------------------
Sector ownership code now completely merged in. Players or teams can now
own sectors and define their laws. Added an option in config.php3 to set
a minimum number of required bases in a sector before a player can claim
ownership

Planet to planet traderoutes are also now implemented, along with various
bug fixes to the traderoute code.

Nospoon (13 November 2001)
-------------------------------
When leaving alliances, sector defences of the player will fight against 
sector defences of the old alliance in the same sector.
When leaving an alliance, any players other than the owner on the planet will
be ejected from the planet.
Option to toggle corporate or personal planet is only shown when you are a
member of an alliance.

Nospoon (09 November 2001)
-------------------------------
Sector defences re-written. Players now get a warning about hostile sector
defences before entering the sector. You can now use cloaking device to attempt
to sneak past sector defences.
Owners of sector defences can retrieve deployed sector defences.
Multiple sector defences (multiple owners in the same alliance) allowed in each sector.
Players can attack hostile sector defences once in a sector.
Can now make unlimited warp links TO a sector, but not from.

Richard Gowen (30 October 2001)

   . furangee_control.php allows for admin control of computer players
   . furangee_funcs.php controls how the computer players function in the game
   . sysupdate.php3 updated to make the computer players take thier turns

Fant0m (29 October 2001 13:26)

Login cookie now uses an implicit domain/path to support finicky browsers & cookie managers. Make sure you update config_local.php3 to specify your correct domain & path.

nospoon (1 October 2001)
------------------------
Emergency warp devices now degrade in reliability depending on hull size.
Ships with a hull size below a certain level won't be attacked by sector defences (mines and fighters).
Traderoutes won't engage between sectors containing hostile sector defences.

gyruss (19 September 2001)
---------------------------
Merged username & password cookies into one userpass cookie. Will soon clean up the other cookies. BNT should only have one cookie overall.


nospoon (16 September 2001)
---------------------------
Added code for reporting on sector defences. Also fixed the existing code for bases on planets. Now, the tech level of the planet defences are based on the ships tech level plus a value in the config file, if a base is present.

nospoon (12 September 2001)
---------------------------

Merged in the in game messaging system by Blindcoder.
Fixed problem with planet_owner being set to null as default.

Added ability to deploy mines and sector fighters (no support for sector fighters attacking yet).


nospoon (07 September 2001)
---------------------------

Fixed Bug in installscript which caused it to fail running the install program.
Changed team scoring algorithm to the same method of the individual player score, so the team score is no longer the sum of the individual players scores, it is now the square root of the net worth of all team members.

ratt (11 July 01) 
------------------
The ridiculous traderoute bug reared it's ugly head again...
Should _NOW_ be fixed (No really!)

Fairly 'major' change is to Ship speed ... currently, with 
an engine level of 15, travel to anywhere in a normal sized
universe took 1 turn... making engine size fairly pointless.

The new calculation method now makes real space trips take 
a bit longer until engine sizes start getting up in the
very high 20's and beyond.  

This means that short real space distance trade ports and/or
warp linked tradeports just because WAY more valuable, as
it should be.  With the soon-to-be introduced mines, it
will make mining valuable port combo's an important tactic.

An alternate way to handle this would have been to increase
the way distance is calculated (to the 4th power instead of
the 2nd) ... still not sure which way would be better.

Any comments on this?

Changed "Trade Route" to "Realspace Trading" on the main 
menu, so people don't get confused.

ratt (09 July 01)
------------------
Refixed the Traderoute bug.  Boy, was that a nasty one
to track down.  It _SHOULD_ be working now - users should
no longer be able to carrying 2x cargo capacity.

Current plan is to finish off the combat code for the portions
that are done right now.  Then to look into adding mines/fighter
clouds, which will lead back to the combat code expansion and
balancing.  I don't want to try to balance the combat code any
more than it already is until the mines are in place, they will
add quite a bit of effect to the entire combat system.  Look
for a much more complex combat system soon, however, that will
require users to actually balance out what type of position they 
wish to take (Offensive/devensive/sneaky/subversive).

First move on this will be a modification to EWD's - currently
they make ship to ship combat non-existant.  Current thinking
right now is to give them a chance of firing a certain % of the
time during each phase of combat.  This will make hanging around
less attractive than logging out on a planet.  With the new
corporate planet options, it will be worth while to concentrate
your corporations ships on a single planet and defend it.

ratt (08 July 01)
------------------
Fixed a bug in corporate planets that killed the
original owner of a planet, even if the original
owner wasn't on that planet.

Comitted current planetary combat code to SF.

This patch is rather large, and includes 3 new files:

1.  CHANGES file - will help in tracking what's changed 
from patch to patch by the developers.

2.  corp.php   ... this is for corporate planets.  It's 
very simple right now, but will be expanded in the future 
to include more options.

3.  combat.php3  - this is the revised combat code.  It is 
NOT finished, but it works (and shares a lot of code) with 
the old combat system.  However, the big chang is the ability 
to have more than one ship on a planet, and those ships to 
defend the planet in concert.

I further plan to modularize the combat code within combat.php3 
to actually handle ALL combat in the game.  Once properly 
modularized, it will allow the ability to leave fighter clouds 
in sectors and will include provisioning for mines.

If you encounter any bugs in the new combat system, please let 
me know ASAP.  Preferably how to duplicate the bug.  I think I 
stamped out most of them.   I am aware that cosmetically, the 
combat system can be improved, and that's on my list of things to do.

As before, if you have not created the field planet_corp in 
your BN database, you need to.  Rebanging the universe will 
do this for you, but I realize for some people, that is not 
an option.  Just duplicate the field planet_owner into 
planet_corp and you should be ok.

If you were currently using the new corporate code, all your 
players should go to thier planets and toggle the corporate 
switch at least once to fix a potential bug in the previous 
code.  New captured planets should not exhibit any more problems.

ratt (06 July 01)
------------------
Fixed a bug in traderoute.php3 that allowed you to have
double the amount of cargo that your holds could handle.

Fixed a bug in the corporate planet scheme that allowed the
original owner unfettered access to a planet after it was
captured if it was set to corporate when it was captured.

Fixed a bug in combat.php3 that would result in
negative fighters being left after a planetary attack,
even if you only lost 1 fighters and had a ton of
fighters left.
