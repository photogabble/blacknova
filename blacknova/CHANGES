Fixed a bug in traderoute.php3 that allowed you to have
double the amount of cargo that your holds could handle.

Fixed a bug in the corporate planet scheme that allowed the
original owner unfettered access to a planet after it was
captured if it was set to corporate when it was captured.

Fixed a bug in planetcombat.php3 that would result in
negative fighters being left after a planetary attack,
even if you only lost 1 fighters and had a ton of
fighters left.
