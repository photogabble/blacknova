nospoon (7 October 2001)
------------------------
Schema change: Made dev_minedeflectors in ships a bigint(20)

gyruss (5 October 2001)
---------------------------
Login cookie now uses an implicit domain/path to support finicky browsers & cookie managers. Make sure you update config_local.php3 to specify your correct domain & path.

nospoon (1 October 2001)
------------------------
Emergency warp devices now degrade in reliability depending on hull size.
Ships with a hull size below a certain level won't be attacked by sector defences (mines and fighters).
Traderoutes won't engage between sectors containing hostile sector defences.

gyruss (19 September 2001)
---------------------------
Merged username & password cookies into one userpass cookie. Will soon clean up the other cookies. BNT should only have one cookie overall.


nospoon (16 September 2001)
---------------------------
Added code for reporting on sector defences. Also fixed the existing code for bases on planets. Now, the tech level of the planet defences are based on the ships tech level plus a value in the config file, if a base is present.

nospoon (12 September 2001)
---------------------------

Merged in the in game messaging system by Blindcoder.
Fixed problem with planet_owner being set to null as default.


nospoon (11 September 2001)
---------------------------

Fixed bug #460170 - duplicate links could be created in create_universe.php3
          #460084 - schema created with null values in key fields
Added ability to deploy mines and sector fighters (no support for sector fighters attacking yet).


nospoon (07 September 2001)
---------------------------

Fixed Bug in installscript which caused it to fail running the install program.
Changed team scoring algorithm to the same method of the individual player score, so the team score is no longer the sum of the individual players scores, it is now the square root of the net worth of all team members.

nospoon (06 September 2001)
--------------------------

Fixed Bug #443677 - Database connection failure in ibank.php3
          #428322 - Unable to transfer planetary $ from IGB

nospoon (05 September 2001)
---------------------------
Fixed bug #405750,458278 - Scores not updating or showing zero scores. File ranking.php3 being overwritten by output from genrank.php3 due to bug in install program

         #433079 - Request for password protection on genrank.php3 to stop malicous users frequently calling this resource intensive process

nospoon (04 September 2001)
---------------------------

Fixed bug #458278 - File open error when scanning unowned planet

nospoon (03 September 2001)
---------------------------

Fixed bug #445681 - couldn't deposit or withdraw all funds from IGB
          #448733 - incorrect parameter passed to gen_score in planet3.php3
          #433078 - longe rang scan incorrectly displaying turns left

The ridiculous traderoute bug reared it's ugly head again...
Should _NOW_ be fixed (No really!)

Fairly 'major' change is to Ship speed ... currently, with 
an engine level of 15, travel to anywhere in a normal sized
universe took 1 turn... making engine size fairly pointless.

The new calculation method now makes real space trips take 
a bit longer until engine sizes start getting up in the
very high 20's and beyond.  

This means that short real space distance trade ports and/or
warp linked tradeports just because WAY more valuable, as
it should be.  With the soon-to-be introduced mines, it
will make mining valuable port combo's an important tactic.

An alternate way to handle this would have been to increase
the way distance is calculated (to the 4th power instead of
the 2nd) ... still not sure which way would be better.

Any comments on this?

Changed "Trade Route" to "Realspace Trading" on the main 
menu, so people don't get confused.

ratt (09 July 01)
------------------
Refixed the Traderoute bug.  Boy, was that a nasty one
to track down.  It _SHOULD_ be working now - users should
no longer be able to carrying 2x cargo capacity.

Current plan is to finish off the combat code for the portions
that are done right now.  Then to look into adding mines/fighter
clouds, which will lead back to the combat code expansion and
balancing.  I don't want to try to balance the combat code any
more than it already is until the mines are in place, they will
add quite a bit of effect to the entire combat system.  Look
for a much more complex combat system soon, however, that will
require users to actually balance out what type of position they 
wish to take (Offensive/devensive/sneaky/subversive).

First move on this will be a modification to EWD's - currently
they make ship to ship combat non-existant.  Current thinking
right now is to give them a chance of firing a certain % of the
time during each phase of combat.  This will make hanging around
less attractive than logging out on a planet.  With the new
corporate planet options, it will be worth while to concentrate
your corporations ships on a single planet and defend it.

ratt (08 July 01)
------------------
Fixed a bug in corporate planets that killed the
original owner of a planet, even if the original
owner wasn't on that planet.

Comitted current planetary combat code to SF.

This patch is rather large, and includes 3 new files:

1.  CHANGES file - will help in tracking what's changed 
from patch to patch by the developers.

2.  corp.php   ... this is for corporate planets.  It's 
very simple right now, but will be expanded in the future 
to include more options.

3.  combat.php3  - this is the revised combat code.  It is 
NOT finished, but it works (and shares a lot of code) with 
the old combat system.  However, the big chang is the ability 
to have more than one ship on a planet, and those ships to 
defend the planet in concert.

I further plan to modularize the combat code within combat.php3 
to actually handle ALL combat in the game.  Once properly 
modularized, it will allow the ability to leave fighter clouds 
in sectors and will include provisioning for mines.

If you encounter any bugs in the new combat system, please let 
me know ASAP.  Preferably how to duplicate the bug.  I think I 
stamped out most of them.   I am aware that cosmetically, the 
combat system can be improved, and that's on my list of things to do.

As before, if you have not created the field planet_corp in 
your BN database, you need to.  Rebanging the universe will 
do this for you, but I realize for some people, that is not 
an option.  Just duplicate the field planet_owner into 
planet_corp and you should be ok.

If you were currently using the new corporate code, all your 
players should go to thier planets and toggle the corporate 
switch at least once to fix a potential bug in the previous 
code.  New captured planets should not exhibit any more problems.

ratt (06 July 01)
------------------
Fixed a bug in traderoute.php3 that allowed you to have
double the amount of cargo that your holds could handle.

Fixed a bug in the corporate planet scheme that allowed the
original owner unfettered access to a planet after it was
captured if it was set to corporate when it was captured.

Fixed a bug in combat.php3 that would result in
negative fighters being left after a planetary attack,
even if you only lost 1 fighters and had a ton of
fighters left.
