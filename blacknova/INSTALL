INSTALLATION

1. Untar the distribution (be sure to untar the subdirectories):
   tar xvf bnt-x.x.x.tar

2. Simply edit the config_local.php3 file to your own settings 
   and manually update your cron file.

   You need to set up a background task thats called every X minutes.
   For the system updates, this is every 6 minutes. For a faster paced 
   game, you can make it every 3 minutes. 
   This task needs to call the web page sysupdate.php3 passing the admin
   password to it, eg by accessing:

   http://localhost/blacknova/sysupdate.php3?swordfish=password
   
   To generate scores / rankings, the scrupt genrank.php3 needs to be called
   with the admin password passed to it, eg:

   http://localhost/blacknova/genrank.php3?swordfish=password

   Normally the script is called every 15 minutes.

   On UNIX and Linux, you can achieve this by using cron to call lynx to access 
   the pages at specified times.

   A third job simply updates the time stamp of a file called cron.txt to let the
   game know when the last update was run. The touch command can do this on Unix / Linux.
   This file needs to reside in the directory containing the game scripts.
   

   A sample crontab follows:

*/6 * * * * /usr/bin/lynx --dump http://localhost/blacknova/sysupdate.php3?swordfish=password > /dev/null
*/6 * * * * /bin/touch /var/www/html/blacknova/cron.txt
*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/lynx --dump http://localhost/blacknova/genrank.php3?swordfish=password > /dev/null

  You may need to alter the URL to point to your exact domain name 
  and path. You will also need to change the password to your admin password


3. Create the database:
   mysqladmin -uuser -ppass create dbname

4. Open the file <www.your-host>/<install-dir>/create_universe.php3 in
   your browser.  You'll need to enter your admin password to access this
   page.  Change the settings to suit the universe you'd like to create -
   and go for it.

5. Open the file <www.your-host>/<install-dir>/index.php3 in your browser
   - you should now be able to log-in.

6. Create a directory in the blacknova directory called player-log.  It should
   be given read-write-execute permissions so the user that your webserver
   runs as can modify the files in player-log and delete files from that
   directory.

7. Hopefully - it works now. :)
