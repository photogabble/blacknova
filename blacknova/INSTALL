INSTALLATION

1. Untar the distribution (be sure to untar the subdirectories):  
   tar xvf bnt-x.x.x.tar

2. Type the following:
   chmod u+x installscript
   ./installscript

3. Create the database:  
   mysqladmin -uuser -ppass create dbname

4. Open the file <www.your-host>/<install-dir>/create_universe.php3 in
   your browser.  You'll need to enter your admin password to access this
   page.  Change the settings to suit the universe you'd like to create -
   and go for it. 

5. Open the file <www.your-host>/<install-dir>/index.php3 in your browser
   - you should now be able to log-in.

6. Create a directory in the blacknova directory called player-log.  It should
   be given read-write-execute permissions so the user that your webserver 
   runs as can modify the files in player-log and delete files from that
   directory.

7. Hopefully - it works now. :)
