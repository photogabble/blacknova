BlackNova Traders - Installation

1. Untar the distribution (be sure to untar the subdirectories):  
   tar xvf bnt-x.x.x.tar
2. Edit the file config.php3 in you favourite editor and change the values
   for host, user, and password to fit your MySQL environment.  Also check
   for other configuration variables specific to your installation (such
   as adminpass and admin_mail for example). If you use a non-standard
   port or UNIX socket for MySQL, also look at the $dbport variable.
3. Create the database:  
	mysqladmin -uuser -ppass create dbname
	mysql -uuser -ppass dbname < blacknova.sql
4. Open the file <www.your-host>/<install-dir>/create_universe.php3 in
   your browser.  You'll need to enter your admin password to access this
   page.  Change the settings to suit the universe you'd like to create -
   and go for it. 
5. Open the file <www.your-host>/<install-dir>/index.php3 in your browser
   - you should now be able to log-in.
6. CRON jobs - here's a copy of my crontab:

*/6 * * * * /usr/bin/lynx --dump http://blacknova.net/sysupdate.php3?swordfish=changeme > /dev/null
*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/lynx --source http://blacknova.net/genrank.php3 > /home2/blacknova/www/ranking.php3
*/6 * * * * /bin/touch /home2/blacknova/cron.txt

   Make sure "changeme" is changed to your admin password, change the 
   path for cron.txt matches whatever is in main.php3 ... this allows
   users to see how long it has been since the last update. 
   The genrank.php3 line creates ranking.php3 for users to see the top 100
   rankings in order to lessen load on the server.
7. Hopefully - it works now. :)

If you need help with the game itself - visit http://blacknova.net and
check out our forums.

If you need help with installation/setup/bugs - you can mail me, but don't
expect a speedy reply - I'm opening a sourceforge.net account for this
game - check there, and submit bugs there.
