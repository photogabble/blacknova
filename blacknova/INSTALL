INSTALLATION

1. Untar the distribution (be sure to untar the subdirectories):
   tar xvf bnt-x.x.x.tar

2. Simply edit the config_local.php3 file to your own settings 
   and manually update your cron file.

   You need to set up a background task thats called every X minutes.
   You can set this to any interval you want, but 5 or 6 minutes are good
   standard values.
   This task needs to call the web page scheduler.php passing the admin
   password to it, eg by accessing:

   http://localhost/blacknova/scheduler.php?swordfish=password
   
   On UNIX and Linux, you can achieve this by using cron to call lynx to access 
   the pages at specified times.


   A sample crontab follows:

*/6 * * * * /usr/bin/lynx --dump http://localhost/blacknova/scheduler.php?swordfish=password > /dev/null

   You may need to alter the URL to point to your exact domain name 
   and path. You will also need to change the password to your admin password

   To specify how fast-paced you want the game to be, you will need to
   edit the file config.php3 and select how many minutes you want between
   different events, eg turns or port regeneration.

3. Create the database:
   mysqladmin -uuser -ppass create dbname

4. Open the file <www.your-host>/<install-dir>/create_universe.php3 in
   your browser.  You'll need to enter your admin password to access this
   page.  Change the settings to suit the universe you'd like to create -
   and go for it.

5. Open the file <www.your-host>/<install-dir>/index.php3 in your browser
   - you should now be able to log-in.

6. Create a directory in the blacknova directory called player-log.  It should
   be given read-write-execute permissions so the user that your webserver
   runs as can modify the files in player-log and delete files from that
   directory.

7. Hopefully - it works now. :)


If you are running php version 4.0.6 or earlier, you will need to comment out 
a line in header.php3 - its one of the first few lines and starts with ob.
There is a comment indicating the line.
PHP 4.0.6 has a memory leak bug.
